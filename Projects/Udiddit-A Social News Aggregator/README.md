# Project: Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator

## Introduction

In this project, I designed and built a highly performant relational database schema needed to build a fully functioning social news aggregator website.

Udiddit is a social news aggregator, content rating, and discussions website. On Udiddit, registered users are able to link to external content or post their own text content about various topics, ranging from common topics such as photography and food, to more arcane ones such as horse masks or birds with arms. In turn, other users can comment on these posts, and each user is allowed to cast a vote about each post, either in an up (like) or down (dislike) direction.
