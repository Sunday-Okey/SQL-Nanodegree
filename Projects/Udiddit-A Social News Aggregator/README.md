## Deforestation Exploration

SQL is most commonly used to manipulate and analyze data to inform decision making. Utilizing Advanced SQL, I contributed to an organization dedicated to combating deforestation globally and promoting environmental awareness. My responsibilities included data wrangling, where I rectified erroneous values within tables, integrated additional categorical and quantitative variables through table joins, and generated new perspectives on data by filtering based on specified criteria. Through this analysis, I was able to identify regions experiencing significant forest depletion and pinpointed areas with substantial forest coverage. Finally, I synthesized findings into comprehensive reports for dissemination to leadership, aiding informed decision-making processes.
